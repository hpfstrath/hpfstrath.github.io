			<p> We are the Human Powered Flight society from Strathclyde University. We are a student run organisation that consists mostly of engineers from across the faculty. </p>
			<p> We were officially founded in the summer of 2022, and have since begun the design of a human-powered aircraft called AETHER that we hope to build and fly over the course of next academic year. </p>
